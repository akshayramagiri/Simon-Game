# Simon-Game

This is about game of memory skill.

# How does the Simon game works?

Press any key to starts the game. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by clicking the same color.

Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
